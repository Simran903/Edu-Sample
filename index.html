          Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such
          as early childhood education, primary education, secondary education,
          higher education, and vocational education. It varies significantly
          according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural),
          gender, caste, religion, language, and disability. Education in India

          Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means
          helping people to learn how to do things and support them to think
          about what they learn. It is also important for educators to teach
          ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out
          how to make it better. Through education, the knowledge of society,
          country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation.
          This may include education in morality, for example learning how to
          act as loyal, honest and effective citizen. Learning in a library
          Education may help and guide individuals from one class to another.
          Educated people and groups can do things like help less-educated
          people and encourage them to get educated.

          Definitions of education aim to describe the essential features of
          education. A great variety of definitions has been proposed. There is
          wide agreement that education involves, among other things, the
          transmission of knowledge. But there are deep disagreements about its
          exact nature and characteristics. Some definitions see education as a
          process exemplified in events like schooling, teaching, and learning.
          Others understand it not as a process but as the product of such
          processes, i.e. as what characterizes educated persons. Various
          attempts have been made to give precise definitions listing its
          necessary and sufficient conditions. The failure of such attempts,
          often in the form of being unable to account for various counter
          examples, has led many theorists to adopt less precise conceptions
          based on family resemblance. On this view, different forms of
          education are similar by having overlapping features but there is no
          set of features shared by all forms. Clarity about the nature of
          education is central for various issues, for example, to coherently
          talk about the subject and to determine how to achieve and measure it.
